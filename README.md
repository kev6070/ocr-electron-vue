A Simple OCR Application built on Electron, Vue.js & Tesseract.js

#### Original idea from blog article: Creating a Simple OCR App with Electron, Vue.js & Tesseract.js 

Nowadays **JavaScript** is one of the most popular programming languages, and used for a lot of fields and platforms through Web. In this tutorial we're going to learn how to build an OCR desktop application with **JavaScript** using **Electron** and **Tesseract.js** ... and guess what... our FE will be implemented with **Vue.js**


## Build Setup

``` bash
# clone repository
git clone https://github.com/lexmartinez/ocr-electron-vue.git

# open project folder
cd ocr-electron-vue

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:9080
npm run dev

# build electron application for production
npm run build

# lint all JS/Vue component files in `src/`
npm run lint
```

## Production Notes

- The OCR engine needs a set of trained data to process the images, in order to execute this app from bundled app/dmg file you should copy the `eng.traineddata` to root folder of you computer.

- The current release supports only image files.
